Welcome to my Readme file!


Rules:
Click the right arrow key to move to the right and vice versa with wanting to move to the left.

Goal:
The goal of Tetris is to get as many lines as possible. So, fill a line horizontally and earn points!!

Practice:
To practice just move the arrow keys and place the blocks whereever. When you're ready to play, just click the Start/Pause button and when you want to take a break click the start/pause button again 

Bugs:
If you put a shape vertically against either a wall or other shape and rotate it, it tends to either go into the shape or teleport the end piece of the shape to the other side of the grid.
Sometimes the game will draw the shape and when it move it leaves the drawing (The trail of the current shape) and will have old drawings on the board at the start of the game. To fix this either restart your browser or move your currently movable shape back into the drawing that was trailing behind it. It will mesh the two back together. Note* This really only happens during the practice, I haven't seen it happen while playing the actual game.
